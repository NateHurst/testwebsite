Journal of Risk Uncertainty 67, 1‚Äì19. Citation Link\nDo people know their own risk preferences, or do risk choices change with experience and observation? We provide a straightforward test in the laboratory. People make an initial decision concerning a lottery choice and then experience 24 unpaid practice periods in which they roll the dice, record the outcome, and record the would-be payoff. They then make a final decision for the lottery choice; one of the first and last periods is randomly chosen for payment. Our primary hypothesis is that people will become less risk-averse by having made and experienced the practice rolls. We do find that people are significantly more likely to become less risk-averse than more risk-averse over time. We note that this move towards assuming increased risk goes in the opposite direction from what is at least arguably predicted by loss aversion and reference dependence. We find that women‚Äôs preferences change much less during a session than men‚Äôs preferences change. We feel that our literally hands-on approach ensures a degree of engagement that helps to accelerate the learning process. We argue that measures obtained after people have had experience with a mechanism are more meaningful and that this principle might well extend more generally to other elicitation tasks."

    "text": "Do Others Believe the Same? Experimental Analysis of Higher-Order Learning and WTP for Information\n üìÖ Date: October 05, 2023 \nThis research explores whether agents consider others‚Äô biases in their belief updating when priors are known to be different and how information acquisition depends on whose strategy is implemented. The strategy method is implemented in a bookbag-and-poker-chip experiment to elicit first and second-order posterior beliefs, and the BDM mechanism is used to elicit their WTP to implement their or others‚Äô strategy. The deviations from Bayes‚Äôs rule found were consistent with previous literature. On average, participants expect others to have the same posterior beliefs independently if they share a common prior or not. However, the presence of heterogeneous priors increases the distance between posterior beliefs and the expectations about others. Finally, it is shown that participants exhibit a larger willingness to pay for information when they implement their strategy rather than the strategy of another participant, which contradicts strategic thinking.\nI presented this paper in the ESA NAM 2023."

The original paper scrutinizes the binarized scoring rule (BSR) method and its effectiveness in incentivizing truthful reporting. Using data from the original controlled laboratory experiments conducted at the Pittsburgh Experimental Economics Laboratory (PEEL), this replication investigates the impact of varying levels of information about incentives on belief reporting accuracy. The findings of the replication confirm systematic biases in belief reporting, particularly a center-bias effect, challenging the behavioral incentive compatibility of the BSR method. Robustness checks further confirm the generalizability of these results across different settings and belief elicitation tasks. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies that ensure both theoretical and behavioral incentive compatibility in belief elicitation."

Making available the alternative of perfect verification experimentally allows us to abstract from a specific fact-checking strategy (some of them more effective and accepted than others) and focus on the potential impact of behavioral biases on the demand for fact-checking.\nWe present experimental results on how changes in the probability of receiving fake news affect the demand for fact-checking. We also explore how the level of government approval affects the demand for fact-checking headlines that are favorable (or not) to the government.\nI presented this paper in the ESA NAM 2024."

This article‚Äôs contribution to existing literature is the analysis of the role of a personality trait named ‚Äúgrit‚Äù in individual microcredit repayment decisions, alongside cognitive characteristics and time and risk preferences. This study is based on a survey of a sample of clients at ‚ÄòProvident M√©xico‚Äô, a formal microfinance institution that provides personal loans in vulnerable communities in Puebla, Mexico. We find evidence that, generally, older individuals possessing higher levels of grit and a tendency toward short term present bias are more likely to show no delays in loan repayments. Cognitive characteristics are inversely related to paying microcredits on time. Refinancing incentives does not play a key role in timely microcredit repayment, a result that is contrary to related literature but consistent with our finding that individuals in this sample that do not have delays in repayments are characterized by showing a short term present bias.\n\nDownload paper here."

My research is centered on how individuals process information, form beliefs, and make decisions under uncertainty, with a focus on misinformation and risk preferences. I combine experimental methods and theoretical modeling to explore these areas, particularly higher-order beliefs, feedback mechanisms, and how people value information.\nRecently, I coauthored the paper ‚ÄúLearning Your Own Risk Preferences,‚Äù published in the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, where I investigate how individuals reassess their own risk preferences over time and through feedback. I published this paper with Nir Chemaya, an excellent researcher from the same cohort, and Gary Charness, who unexpectedly left us. During the PhD, I kept working on papers I started in Mexico that were finally published. Finally, I designed, programmed, and implemented my own experiments, where I studied higher-order belief updating the value of information, and the willingness to pay to verify in the context of verification.\nI am currently in the Job Market as I near the completion of my Ph.D.¬†in 2025. I‚Äôm excited to continue my work in economic research, focusing on information economics and decision theory. My JMP explores the feedback‚Äôs role in improving decision-making accuracy, especially in combating misinformation."
