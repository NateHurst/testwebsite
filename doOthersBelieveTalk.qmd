This research explores whether agents consider othersâ€™ biases in their belief updating when priors are known to be different and how information acquisition depends on whose strategy is implemented. The strategy method is implemented in a bookbag-and-poker-chip experiment to elicit first and second-order posterior beliefs, and the BDM mechanism is used to elicit their WTP to implement their or othersâ€™ strategy. The deviations from Bayesâ€™s rule found were consistent with previous literature. On average, participants expect others to have the same posterior beliefs independently if they share a common prior or not. However, the presence of heterogeneous priors increases the distance between posterior beliefs and the expectations about others. Finally, it is shown that participants exhibit a larger willingness to pay for information when they implement their strategy rather than the strategy of another participant, which contradicts strategic thinking.
