We present results of a lab experimental study of candidate entry in a citizencandidate environment under plurality and run-off electoral systems, varying both entry costs and ideal points of the potential candidates. The comparative predictions of the citizen-candidate model are shown to hold; however, subjects exhibit substantial degree of over-entry from electorally disadvantaged positions.
